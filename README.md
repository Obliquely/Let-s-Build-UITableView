# Let's Build UITableView #

A re-implementation of a (stripped down) version of the iOS UITableView class for learning purposes.

Thanks to Mike Ash and his [NSBlog](http://www.mikeash.com/pyblog).

Detailed documentation included in the source (documentation.txt) and viewable within the test application.

(Minor change. Just testing.)
